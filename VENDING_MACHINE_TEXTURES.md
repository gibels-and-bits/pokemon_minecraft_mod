# Vending Machine Texture Guide

The following texture files need to be created for the vending machine:

## Block Textures (16x16 pixels each)
- `src/main/resources/assets/etbmod/textures/block/vending_machine_front.png` - Front face with display/buttons
- `src/main/resources/assets/etbmod/textures/block/vending_machine_side.png` - Side panels  
- `src/main/resources/assets/etbmod/textures/block/vending_machine_top.png` - Top of the machine

## GUI Texture (176x166 pixels)
- `src/main/resources/assets/etbmod/textures/gui/vending_machine.png` - Container GUI background

## Texture Design Suggestions

### Block Textures
- **Front**: Should show a glass display window, coin slot for diamonds, and dispensing area
- **Sides**: Metal panels with Pokemon-themed decorations
- **Top**: Simple metal top, possibly with Pokemon logo

### GUI Layout
The GUI texture should include:
- Diamond input slot at position (26, 35)
- 3x3 output grid starting at (116, 17) with 18 pixel spacing
- Player inventory area starting at (8, 84)
- Player hotbar at (8, 142)

The vending machine is inspired by real Pokemon vending machines and should have a yellow/Pokemon-themed color scheme to match the image reference provided.
